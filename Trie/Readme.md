The Trie is an efficient tree-based data structure commonly used to store dynamic sets of strings. Each node represents a single character, enabling the Trie to store strings in a way that allows for fast retrieval and search. Itâ€™s particularly useful for handling prefix-based queries, like autocompletion, spell-checking, and IP routing. Insertion and search operations in a Trie run in O(L) time, where L is the length of the word, making it highly efficient for dictionary-related applications.

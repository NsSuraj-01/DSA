Segment trees are widely used for efficiently handling range queries and updates on arrays, especially in scenarios where optimization is crucial. Unlike traditional data structures, segment trees enable queries and modifications over ranges in logarithmic time, making them ideal for dynamic data. 
Each node in a segment tree represents a segment of the array, storing aggregated information like sum, minimum, or maximum over that range. This structure is particularly useful in competitive programming and applications where frequent updates and fast query responses are essential, such as interval-based scheduling and gaming leaderboards.
